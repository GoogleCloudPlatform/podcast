We're learning all about Arm servers on Google Cloud Platform this week. Hosts [Brian Dorsey](https://twitter.com/briandorsey) and [Stephanie Wong](https://twitter.com/stephr_wong) welcome fellow Googlers [Jon Masters](https://twitter.com/jonmasters) and [Emma Haruka Iwao](https://twitter.com/Yuryu) to talk about the newest VMs on GCP.

To start, our guests dive in to Arm, explaining what it is and how it's grown over the years. Nowadays, Arm-based chips dominate the mobile market and this volume has allowed them to build both advanced chips for supercomputers and beneficial partnerships. Emma explains how having the Arm architecture available in the cloud helps keep projects efficient and walks us through example setups of an Arm projects, illustrating the ease of setup in Google Cloud. Jon and Emma talk about the T2A VMs running Arm workloads at Google, including their balance of performance and cost. 

Emma and Jon bust some myths about Arm, emphasizing how performant it is despite its humble beginnings.
