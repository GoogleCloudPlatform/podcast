[Alexandrina Garcia-Verdin](https://twitter.com/open_eco_source) and [Stephanie Wong](https://twitter.com/stephr_wong) host this week's episode all about managing non-REST APIs. Guests [Nandan Sridhar](https://twitter.com/srinandans) and [Dave Feuer](https://twitter.com/readyaimfeuer) start the show introducing our listeners to Apigee, a full life cycle API management tool, and the three tenets of Apigee that streamline the relationship between producers of APIs and their users.

APIs have come a long way as technologies have changed, and David explains the evolution of API development and how it relates to the newer non-REST APIs. The consumption of applications has significantly changed, but Nandan points out that developer strategies and experiences have also changed. These advances have led to the popularity of non-REST APIs. APIs are being used in new ways David tells us, and through examples, we hear how Apigee is helping these companies realize their cutting-edge API goals. 

Nandan helps our listeners understand the difference between REST and non-REST APIs and the advantages of the latter in today's technological environments. Each of the four main types of non-REST APIs have their specialities, he explains, like GraphQL which is great for experiences, and gRPC, which has special communication features that increase efficiency. Our guests elaborate on the exciting features of these two protocols and how their uses will continue to innovate business and consumer interactions into the future. 

Our guests offer advice for companies and developers looking to take advantage of these non-REST APIs and help us understand the role Apigee plays in protecting the quality of all types of APIs.
