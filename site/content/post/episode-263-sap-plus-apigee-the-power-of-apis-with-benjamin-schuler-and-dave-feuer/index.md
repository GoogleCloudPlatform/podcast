[Max Saltonstall](https://twitter.com/maxsaltonstall) and [Carter Morgan](https://twitter.com/carterthecomic) co-host the podcast this week and talk APIs with our guests, [Dave Feuer](https://twitter.com/readyaimfeuer) and Benjamin Schuler. Apigee, an API management platform that is a part of Google Cloud, focuses on all steps of the digital product life cycle to make API management easy for clients. The software company SAP provides data storage and other business support for different types of  companies across the world. Together, Apigee and SAP allow data to be collected, stored, organized, and securely accessed and shared with other applications.

The shift to e-commerce and the desire for tailored experiences has driven the need for more API usage and therefore better API management. SAP and Apigee, with their myriad features, allow businesses to keep up with these increasing demands efficiently. We hear examples of how companies are leveraging these tools and use cases where the power of SAP and Apigee benefit customers most. Our guests describe the developer experience as well. We talk about the process of creating a project with both SAP and Apigee and why both tools working together makes the developer's job easier. Planning your project with an "API first" mindset means choosing APIs and SAP software early in the planning process to better align your project with your business goals. Apigee can help you manage these APIs securely, letting you choose the data that is shared. The use of both SAP and Apigee helps companies to realize long-term efficiency and streamlined operations as development becomes easier with each additional API.
