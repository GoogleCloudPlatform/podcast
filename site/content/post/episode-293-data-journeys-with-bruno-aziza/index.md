On the show this week, [Mark Mirchandani](https://twitter.com/markmirch) and [Stephanie Wong](https://twitter.com/stephr_wong) share two popular episodes of [Bruno Aziza](https://twitter.com/brunoaziza)'s YouTube series Data Journeys. 

First up, Bruno talks with Aaron Biller of Postmates about their triangle of complex data that includes customer, courier, and merchant. He details their data storage and analytics structure, describing it as a reverse pyramid of tons of data with few engineers to manage and analyze it. To handle this, Postmates takes a stay-out-of-the-way approach by providing good data and letting the analysts do what they do best without micromanaging. Aaron talks about this data architecture, including the use of BigQuery as data lakes to keep data storage simple, and how Google collaboration tools streamline access and authorization tasks. Communication and flexibility are important, Aaron tells us, and he offers other advice for companies designing data systems. Feedback loops, dedicated training, and an open environment with no silos also help foster a productive, healthy data workplace.

Matteo of Delivery Hero speaks to Bruno next. With the goal of increasing their global reach and offerings, it's important that Delivery Hero has a smooth data system. Matteo outlines the new data structure they've built to ease onboarding of new companies and territories and describes different use cases for their data. From determining the number of delivery people necessary in each area to offering personalized customer recommendations, Delivery Hero uses Google offerings like Google Analytics and BigQuery to interpret collected data. Matteo details how they tailor data infrastructures for each use case and offers tips to help companies think through their data infrastructure design. Don't work in a bubble, Matteo stresses, and focus on thorough onboarding of team members and clear communication with colleagues and customers.
