[Brian Dorsey](https://twitter.com/briandorsey) and [Mark Mirchandani](https://twitter.com/markmirch) team up this week to speak with [Thomas Jung](https://twitter.com/thomas_jung) and [Lucia Subatin](https://twitter.com/LuciaBlick) about SAP. SAP, the company that builds software and other technology components, is probably best known for their Enterprise Resource Planning software that helps businesses with everything from accounting to order management. Their Customer Relationship Management software helps companies with things like marketing campaign management and sales, while SAP's Supplier Relationship Management software helps clients manage large supply chains. 

Thomas explains how companies can get started with SAP products and integrate them into their current systems. Once SAP products are employed, clients benefit from a better understanding of their complete business and a more efficient company. SAP developers must have great communication skills, as they take SAP products and tailor them to each individual company, whether on-prem or in the cloud. Later, Lucia and Thomas describe instances when clients may want to take their core businesses and enhance them with technologies like AI and how this is possible.

To wrap up the episode, Thomas and Lucia introduce us to SAP products like HANA, their Cloud Application Programming Model, and security measures.
