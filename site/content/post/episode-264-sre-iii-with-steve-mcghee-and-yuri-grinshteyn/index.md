Our old pal [Mark Mirchandani](https://twitter.com/markmirch) is back this week, joining [Stephanie Wong](https://twitter.com/stephr_wong) and our guests [Steve McGhee](https://twitter.com/stevemcghee) and [Yuri Grinshteyn](https://twitter.com/YuriGrinshteyn)  to talk about Site Reliability Engineering. SRE is Google's way of helping companies of all sizes create consistent, predictable, and functional projects. It helps clients approach operations from a software engineering stand point so that growing systems can be managed efficiently.

We talk about the challenges of implementing best SRE practices and how companies can overcome these. Though the benefits of SRE are many, it can be difficult for clients to grasp. Steve and Yuri tell us the process they go through with customers to help them set realistic goals and work to make reliable, scalable projects with little downtime. By starting small and taking wins early, Steve says clients reap the rewards of SRE and are encouraged to push forward. Yuri's customer-centric approach encourages companies to prioritize alerts that affect the user experience, thus limiting inbox mayhem and keeping customers happy. Alerts based on symptoms, Steve says, help accomplish this goal.

Later, Yuri and Steve describe the best ways for companies to get started with SRE. Realistic goals and specific detailed plans can make the journey less bumpy for clients, and Google's SRE team can help.

##### Steve McGhee

[Steve](https://twitter.com/stevemcghee) was an SRE at Google for about 10 years, then left to help a company build reliable systems on the Cloud.  Now he's back at Google, helping more companies do that.

##### Yuri Grinshteyn

[Yuri](https://twitter.com/YuriGrinshteyn) works with Google Cloud Platform customers to help them design, architect, build, and operate reliable applications and services. He also advocates for SRE principles and practices on YouTube and elsewhere.
