Welcome back to a new year of Google Cloud Platform Podcasts! [Mark Mirchandani](https://twitter.com/markmirch) and [Emma Iwao](https://twitter.com/Yuryu) host the first show of 2021 with special guest Rebecca Weekly of Intel. She joins us to talk about the partnership between Google Cloud and Intel. Describing the company's goals of gathering, storing, managing, and analyzing data in all its forms to unlock the power of technology and information, Rebecca points out how well these align with Google's own goals and why the partnership is such a natural fit.

Rebecca explains the four pillars of the Google-Intel partnership, including the focus on infrastructure and app modernization to elevate the user experience. Through their work with Google, Intel has been able to optimize the move from on prem to cloud for those clients who choose to make the shift, using their thorough client knowledge and Google Cloud expertise to facilitate a smooth transition. Rebecca walks us through the process of crafting this client experience, from choosing products and tools to identifying and solving any bottlenecks and optimizing the configuration using benchmarks.

Later, we talk about the value of open source software in both the hardware and software worlds and why Intel believes so strongly in open source projects. Rebecca offers examples of clients successfully using Intel hardware and Google Cloud software, including Climacell and Kinsta. We get the inside scoop on future projects at Intel, like the next generation of scalable Xeon processors, and Rebecca talks about the future of data analyzation and computing.

##### Rebecca Weekly

Rebecca leads the team that influences nearly every aspect of our cloud platform solutions across strategic planning, hardware and software enabling, marketing and sales. Together they shape the development, production, and business strategy of Intel’s cloud platforms to ensure differentiation and platforms that enable TAM expansion with enthusiasm, collaboration, and urgency. She drives strategic collaborations with key partners including top cloud service providers, OxMs, ISVs & OSVs to ensure platform requirements meet our customer needs.
 
In her "spare" time, she’s the lead singer of a funk & soul band, Sinister Dexter, was professionally trained in dance (tap, modern, and jazz), and is an experienced choreographer. She has two amazing little boys and loves to run (after them, and on her own).
 
Rebecca graduated from MIT with a degree in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.
