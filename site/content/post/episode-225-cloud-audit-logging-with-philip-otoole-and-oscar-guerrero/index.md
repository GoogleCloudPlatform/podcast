This week, [Mark Mirchandani](https://twitter.com/markmirch) and [Priyanka Vergadia](https://twitter.com/pvergadia) learn all about Cloud Audit Logging with fellow Googlers Philip O'Toole and Oscar Guerrero. Our guests explain the importance of Cloud Audit Logs to keep track of your GCP resources so you know who, what, where, and when things were done. Our guests explain the types of logs GCP offers and why each is important for security. The interview continues with a discussion the various other benefits of audit logging, including proof of compliance and measuring of risk.

Because audit logs have the ability to create more data than some businesses can use, Philip and Oscar help our listeners understand how to choose the correct logging services for their needs, and we learn how Cloud Logging can help users digest their data. Philip describes how audit logs and event driven systems can benefit businesses, explaining how event driven systems can be built and pushed with GCP. Oscar continues the conversation with audit logging in G Suite. The Cloud Logging team is continuing to expand offerings, so be on the lookout!
