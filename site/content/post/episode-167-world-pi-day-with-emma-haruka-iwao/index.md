World Pi Day is behind us, but our guest today, [Emma Iwao](https://twitter.com/Yuryu), joins hosts [Gabi](https://twitter.com/gabidavila) and [Mark](https://twitter.com/Neurotic) to teach us all about pi. Pi is the constant of the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. Anytime you see a circle on a computer, pi has been used. It's vital for everything from gaming to calculating rocket trajectories!

Emma crushed the world record for calculating digits of pi using Google Cloud over four months! Listen in to hear more about how she did it!
