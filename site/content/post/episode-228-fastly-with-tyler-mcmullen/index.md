[Tyler McMullen](https://twitter.com/tbmcmullen) of Fastly is with us today, telling our hosts [Mark Mirchandani](https://twitter.com/markmirch) and [Brian Dorsey](https://twitter.com/briandorsey) all about the company, CDNs, and more.

Fastly is an edge cloud platform, focusing on ways to improve the more customer-focused side of the cloud with things like latency reduction, efficient scaling, and more. Content Delivery Networks can be a part of this, due to their proximity to customers and better caching. Edge cloud takes pieces of normal cloud setups and moves them to the edge of the cloud, closer to the customer, to achieve better speed. Tyler explains what pieces make sense to move out to the edge and what he sees as the future of edge cloud platforms.

Later in the show, Tyler tells us how to analyze projects and make decisions on the use of edge cloud, CDNs, and microservices. He explains the technical process of using an edge cloud platform too, giving examples of situations that might benefit from a more edge cloud approach. WebAssembly, technology originally created for web browsers, actually plays a role in Fastly's edge platforms, Tyler explains, going further into the technical side of how the engineers at Fastly have created this system to run smoothly while also being easy to build on.

In the future, Tyler hopes to see WebAssembly support more languages so compiling and distributing can be even easier.
