We're back for a new, exciting year of the Google Cloud Platform Podcast! [Mark Mirchandani](https://twitter.com/markmirch) and [Carter Morgan](https://twitter.com/carterthecomic) start 2022 with a jointly hosted interview with [Anton Chuvakin](https://twitter.com/anton_chuvakin) and [Timothy Peacock](https://twitter.com/_TimPeacock) of the Cloud Security Podcast team. Our guest, Phil Venables, is here to tell us about the driving trends in cloud security today.

Phil starts the show with a discussion on the advances in cloud security in general and how it compares with on-prem security. Megatrends like economies of scale and competition between cloud providers benefit cloud users by allowing better security for less money. Cloud environments tend to be simpler and therefore easier to manage, and with scaling and geographic location options, cloud projects allow more flexibility to reach security and sustainability goals.

Phil talks about the iteration process of advances in security based on customer requirements and how this builds client trust. The Shared Responsibility Model, where the cloud provider runs a secure infrastructure and the customer configures their project securely in the cloud, is a great start, Phil tells us. But with Shared Fate, he sees the provider crossing the responsibility barrier to work together with the client towards a secure project through actions like analyzation of security defaults. Customer feedback helps Google Cloud make a better product, which in turn helps customers, creating an environment of reliability and shared trust.

We talk about how the Shared Fate model and shared incentives work together to create a closer partnership between cloud providers and customers, and Phil elaborates on the idea of project security as an immune system. We tackle the idea of security diversity and whether it benefits clients to expand their security outside of cloud provider offerings. Phil helps security novices understand valuable feature-add security services and what to look for in the future.
