On the podcast this week, your hosts [Stephanie Wong](https://twitter.com/stephr_wong) and [Mark Mirchandani](https://twitter.com/markmirch) talk about the data processing tool Apache Beam with guests [Pablo Estrada](https://twitter.com/polecito) and [Kenneth Knowles](https://twitter.com/KennKnowles). 

Kenn starts us off with an overview of how Apache Beam began and how Cloud Dataflow was involved. The unique batch and stream method and emphasis on correctness garnered support from developers early on and continues to attract users. Pablo helps us understand why Beam is a better option for certain projects looking to process large amounts of data. Our guests describe how Beam may be a better fit than microservices that could become obsolete as company needs change. 

Next, we step back and take a look at why batch and stream is the gold standard of data processing because of its balance between low latency and ease of "being done" with data collection. Beam's focus on the correctness of data and correctness in processing that data is a core component. With good data, processing becomes easier, more reliable, and cheaper. Kenn gives examples of how things can go wrong with bad data processing. Beam strives for the perfect combination of low latency, correct data, and affordability. Users can choose where to run Beam pipelines, from other Apache software offerings to Dataflow, which means excellent flexibility. Our guests talk about the pros and cons of some of these options and we hear examples of how companies are using Beam along with supporting software to solve data processing challenges.

To get started with Beam, check out Beam College or attend Beam Summit 2022.
