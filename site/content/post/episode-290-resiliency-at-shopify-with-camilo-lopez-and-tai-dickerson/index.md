[Carter Morgan](https://twitter.com/carterthecomic) and [Stephanie Wong](https://twitter.com/stephr_wong) host Shopify guests [Camilo Lopez](https://twitter.com/CamiloLopez) and Tai Dickerson this week. Shopify streamlines the online purchasing process so merchants and customers can transact with confidence.

Camilo and Tai talk in-depth about Shopify's tech stack and why the choices made are so important to performance. Shopify engineers use a combination of Ruby on Rails, MySQL and Google products like Kubernetes. Resiliency systems like active-active configurations, chat ops for quick solutions, and bot and overload protection are worked in. By leveraging these tools and staying flexible in their resiliency efforts, Shopify is able to adjust to new merchant requirements and teams are able to work efficiently.

While tech continues to progress and change, the Shopify culture remains a driving force for advancement, Camilo tells us. The company ideals and axioms help steer the brand and dictate which technologies they'll use to solve new and changing client demands. The 2014 outage shaped the future of these cultural ideals, emphasizing the need for quick action and resiliency components like constraints to ensure system safety. Shopify engineers also built enhanced testing tools like Toxiproxy to simulate poor network conditions and account for potential issues.

The 2021 Black Friday Cyber Monday shopping season was Shopify's biggest yet. Camilo and Tai describe how Shopify's resiliency culture and intense prep work made the biggest shopping weekend of the year so successful. By offering educational tools and a support network that values good communication, their company culture continues to grow, and Tai tells us how it's not just the software that should be resilient. Building a resilient, flexible company culture is just as important.

Camilo talks about Shopify's recent shift to a completely remote work place and the new challenges and opportunities it presents.
