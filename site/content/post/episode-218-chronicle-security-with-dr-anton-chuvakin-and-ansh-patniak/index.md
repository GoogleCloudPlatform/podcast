It's cyber security week on the podcast as  [Priyanka Vergadia](https://twitter.com/pvergadia) joins [Mark Mirchandani](https://twitter.com/markmirch) to talk with the folks of the Chronicle Security Team. Our guests Ansh Patniak and Dr. Anton Chuvakin start the show off with a brief explanation of Chronicle, which is a security analytics platform that can identify threats and correct them. 

Anton details the threats facing clients today and why it's important to continue to guard against old threats as well. Cyber security developers must constantly examine the landscape, adjust tools used, and think ahead to try to predict possible future problems. Ansh elaborates, pointing out that sometimes, all the security needed to protect against old, current, and potentially new threats can create a data overload that causes some threats to be lost in a jungle of notifications. Analyzing this data to gain insights about the health of a company's cyber security is an important part of the process, and Chronicle can help with that. We discuss other challenges in the security analytics world and learn tips and tricks to help overcome them. 

Our guests wrap up the show explaining how Chronicle, as part of GCP, benefits Google Cloud customers.
