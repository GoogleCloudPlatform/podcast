This week on the show, Lorin Price and [Stephanie](https://twitter.com/stephr_wong) talk about the differences between traditional and service networking with guest Ryan Przybyl. Ryan starts the show telling us how customer needs and advancing cloud technologies have shifted the conversations he has with customers from a traditional networking focus to an emphasis on cloud services.

Ryan describes how he helps different sized companies approach networking, whether they're cloud native or shifting to a cloud approach from a traditional background. For example, companies that take advantage of Google Cloud and its services can deploy environments quickly, allowing developers to work without infrastructure constraints. Enterprise companies using more traditional networking that move into the cloud will need to make some changes, Ryan says, comparing apples to oranges. They want to move in a way that takes advantage of the cloud without negatively impacting performance.

Later, Ryan tells us all about service-oriented networking and how it's possible for companies to choose pieces to shift to a service-oriented architecture without re-doing the entire project. We learn about Google's Private Service Connect which handles things like routing for companies connecting to third party services. Ryan offers some advice for companies considering this move and regales us with interesting anecdotes from his time helping clients.
