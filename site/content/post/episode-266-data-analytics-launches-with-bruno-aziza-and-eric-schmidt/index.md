[Stephanie Wong](https://twitter.com/stephr_wong) and [Jenny Brown](https://twitter.com/jbrojbrojbro) are your hosts this week, discussing data analytics with the yin and yang of the field, [Bruno Aziza](https://twitter.com/brunoaziza) and [Eric Schmidt](https://twitter.com/notthateric). Our guests introduce us to three new Google offerings, Big Query Omni, Dataplex, and the Analytics Hub, and discuss the uses and implications of each and how they work together to achieve goals.

Bruno and Eric describe challenges in data analytics and how Google uses these as opportunities to create problem-solving systems that solve real client problems. Through real-world examples from companies like Equifax, we see how companies are getting more information from their data in a way that creates actionable opportunities to improve customer experiences. 

For multi-cloud companies, Big Query Omni gets the most out of data that exists in multiple clouds. To accomplish this, Google takes the analytics to the data and is able to reach all appropriate data across clouds without having to move it. This allows for cheaper analysis with much less system downtime. Support for Azure was added this year. 

The new Dataplex software helps customers intelligently manage data assets, especially in distributed systems. Dataplex lets companies automatically discover data, make data secure without having to move it, and apply governance and policies centrally so the data is accessible. Rather than sit unused, data can now be found easily, analyzed securely, and put to work for companies no matter where their data lives.

For analytic asset sharing, Analytics Hub lets companies coordinate with others to get the most use out of their data efficiently. Analytics Hub gets to data value as quickly and easily as possible. Companies can publish, discover, and subscribe to shared assets, create exchanges that combine data sets, and curate exchanges of data and insights for full information sharing.

##### Eric Schmidt

[Eric](https://twitter.com/notthateric) is the Head of Advocacy for Data Analytics at Google and has been with us for almost 8 years. He comes to us from Microsoft, where he led Advocacy and Evangelism there, too.  Eric is an expert in products like BigQuery, Dataflow, Dataproc and leads a team of leaders who help customers turn data into value. In his downtime, Eric is also a Dj at KEXP 90.3 Seattel - KEPX.ORG where he guest hosts a modern global music show. You can find Eric on Twitter.  His handle is [@notthateric](https://twitter.com/notthateric) - not to be confused with the ‘other Eric Schmidt’ here at Google.  In fact, internally, we affectionately call him “cloude”.

##### Bruno Aziza

Bruno is the Head of Data & Analytics at Google Cloud and specializes in everything data, from data analytics, to business intelligence, data science, and artificial intelligence.

Before working at Google, Bruno worked at companies like Business Objects when it went IPO and Oracle, where his team led one of the fastest turnarounds in the business analytics industry. He led the launch of startups like Alpine Data (now part of Tibco), Sisense and AtScale and he helped Microsoft grow its Data unit into a $1B business. Bruno has been educated in the US, France, the UK, and Germany. He has written two books on Data Analytics and Performance Management.  And he has a monthly column on Forbes.com on everything Data, AI and Analytics.
