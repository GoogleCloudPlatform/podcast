We're sad to say goodbye to [Mark Mandel](https://twitter.com/Neurotic) this week but excited to bring you an interview he and guest host [Robert Martin](https://twitter.com/cloudrobx) did with Björn Lindberg of [Massive Entertainment](https://www.massive.se/). The gaming studio is located in Sweden and owned by Ubisoft. Their most recent game, [The Division 2](https://tomclancy-thedivision.ubisoft.com/game/en-us/home), is a "looter shooter" game that was released in March. It can be played solo or users can be matched up to play with or against others.

To keep the game running smoothly, Massive employs a micro-service architecture to divide and conquer the trials of creating and running such a large, intense game. The Division 2 was launched with Google Cloud, a process Björn says was a bit easier than launching on physical hardware. Autoscaling in the cloud has created a simpler, more trustworthy gaming process as well, and by connecting to data centers in multiple regions, they're able to decrease latency.
