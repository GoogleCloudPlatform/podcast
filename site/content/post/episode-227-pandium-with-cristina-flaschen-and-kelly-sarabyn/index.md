This week is all about business-to-business marketplace software with Pandium as [Mark Mirchandani](https://twitter.com/markmirch) and [Max Saltonstall](https://twitter.com/maxsaltonstall) talk with our guests [Cristina Flaschen](https://twitter.com/cflaschen) and Kelly Sarabyn. The Pandium platform helps companies build and support in-app marketplaces with a focus on software integration and flexibility. 

Kelly and Cristina start by explaining how Pandium deals with scalability for clients with multiple users and partners. Cristina elaborates on Pandium's role in facilitating integrations, helping customers build customized, flexible solutions. We discuss how APIs are handled and the way Pandium takes care of authentication, security, and other standard pieces. 

We continue with a thorough discussion of 'yes code', 'low code', and 'no code' approaches, and the benefits and drawbacks of each system. With a combination approach of some 'no code' tools and other 'yes code' pieces, Pandium allows better customization in any code language, while keeping some functions easy for non-engineers.
