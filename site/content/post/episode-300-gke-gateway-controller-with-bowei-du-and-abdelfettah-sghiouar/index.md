Hosts [Anthony Bushong](https://twitter.com/agmsbusho) and [Kaslin Fields](https://twitter.com/kaslinfields) welcome Bowei Du and [Abdelfettah Sghiouar](https://twitter.com/boredabdel) to talk about the Gateway Controller, a tool that helps developers use the Gateway API in GKE. 

Bowei starts the show with a thorough explanation of how and why the Gateway Controller was developed. Compared to tools like Ingress, Gateway Controller allows engineers to implement more expressive solutions. While providing developers with portability has been an important part of Gateway Controller, it also gives developers freedom to use non-portable features in a structured, consistent environment and helps manage tenancy across different teams. Bowei and Abdel describe the difference between Ingress and Service and how these tools fit in with Gateway Controller. Abdel walks us through how a company would use the Gateway Controller for optimal tenancy management across name spaces and how this is an improvement over Ingress and Service. He gives examples of how companies are using this new tool. 

We hear more about the GKE Gateway Controller and how its fully-managed deployments and integration with other Google APIs make it so easy to use. Bowei tells us how Gateway helps with the unification of mesh and non mesh environments through the standardization of noun describers in both instances. A handy edge to mesh tutorial is available to help developers.

##### Abdelfettah Sghiouar

[Abdel](https://twitter.com/boredabdel) is a Cloud Dev Advocate with a focus on Cloud native, GKE, and Service Mesh technologies. 

##### Bowei Du
