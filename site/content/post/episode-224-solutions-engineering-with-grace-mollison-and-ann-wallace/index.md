[Mark Mirchandani](https://twitter.com/markmirch) and [Priyanka Vergadia](https://twitter.com/pvergadia) host this week's episode of the podcast, with a thorough discussion of Solutions Engineering at Google. Our guests, [Grace Mollison](https://twitter.com/grapesfrog) and [Ann Wallace](https://twitter.com/annnwallace), explain that the Solutions Engineering team is there to help customers choose appropriate products for things like security, analytics, data management, and more. The products are laid out in guides and blueprints so the client can easily understand why products are chosen and how to use them. 

Grace and Ann talk later in the podcast about the Solutions Engineering blueprints that Solutions Engineering Architects have begun creating. They describe how the idea came about, how they're built, as well as the types of blueprints that are available and how to use them. The team is still working to create more blueprints and make them even easier to use. 

##### Grace Mollison
