[Kaslin Fields](https://twitter.com/kaslinfields) and [Mark Mirchandani](https://twitter.com/markmirch) host this week's episode of the podcast as we celebrate one of our favorite Google products, Google Kubernetes Engine! [Anthony Bushong](https://twitter.com/agmsbwho) and [Gari Singh](https://twitter.com/garitweets) join the party to talk about GKE's life journey, what's new, and what's coming up for the service.

Each guest brings their unique perspective to the show starting with their definitions of Kubernetes and GKE, tailored to a six year old. How does Kubernetes relate to cookies, Disney World, and Pokemon? Kaslin, Anthony, and Gari break it down.

Next, each guest talks their favorite GKE features and what makes the service different. Kaslin loves the persistent storage feature, among others. Anthony appreciates the evolution of GKE to a place where it supports many different workloads and situations for clients and how easy it is to get started with GKE. GKE's ability to connect easily to other GCP products and features and GKE Autopilot are some of Gari's favorite things about the service. 

Best practices and advice for new users are shared by our guests. From practical tips for project planning to encouragement with long-term problem solving, our guests offer listeners resources and ideas for a successful GKE project. Kaslin, Anthony, and Gari share their favorite customer stories with us and talk about the fun, interesting events Google has hosted for GKE customers.

The future of GKE looks bright, with new options for Windows containers, expanded Autopilot uses, and multicluster support. KubeCon is coming up soon, so keep an eye out for more Kubernetes and GKE news!
