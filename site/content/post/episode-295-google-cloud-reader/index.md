On the show this week, we're talking about Google Cloud Reader, a nifty podcast we created to narrate Google Tech blog posts. Host [Jenny Brown](https://twitter.com/jbrojbrojbro) tells us her inspiration for creating Google Cloud Reader and she and cohost [Stephanie Wong](https://twitter.com/stephr_wong) walk us through a series of published episodes.

First up, we learn what Cloud SQL Maintenance is and how customers can customize maintenance schedules to limit the impacts of downtime. Region picker is the topic of our next segment, and we hear how it helps projects stay cost efficient while conserving resources. Using three inputs, companies can decide quickly which region offers the best balance between cost, latency, and carbon footprint for them. Next, we learn about search abandonment's effect on brand loyalty and how important it is for the right products to show in search results.

We tackle the working environment with the next piece, redefining productivity to make it more personal and less robotic and offering advice on being productive while maintaining a good work-life balance. Making learning more personalized is the subject of our next segment. We hear how Google is using AI to aid the instruction of students no matter their learning style. Building diversity, equity, and inclusion into companies is important for success, and our last segment offers advice on how to incorporate DEI initiatives to ensure employees feel valued.
