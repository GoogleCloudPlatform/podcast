[Brian Dorsey](https://twitter.com/briandorsey) and [Kaslin Fields](https://twitter.com/kaslinfields) welcome [Kat Cosgrove](https://twitter.com/Dixie3Flatline) of [Pulumi](https://twitter.com/PulumiCorp) this week to talk about what's new with Kubernetes 1.24. Pulumi is infrastructure as code, allowing developers to use whatever language they are comfortable with to create and test infrastructure. Kat walks us through typical Pulumi infrastructure test scenarios to demonstrate the benefits of this software, especially with GCP. 

In the new Kubernetes release, one of the biggest updates is the removal of Dockershim. If you're using a managed Kubernetes service through GCP, this update should not affect you, Kat tells us. She clears up some common Docker misconceptions and tells us how Kubernetes and Docker still work together. Kat describes the situations where this update might affect certain projects and how to tell if you're one of the unlucky few. 

Later, we talk about the future of tech conferences. Kat is excited to get back to some in-person learning and networking, but at the same time, is hopeful that conferences will continue a hybrid model and allow some online interaction. Pulumi will be at KubeCon, Devlopsdays, and Jfokus in the next few months with some cool new free merchandise.

Brian just started releasing the next [six episodes of VMs End-to-end](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIivdWyY5sqIteZONy-rTwyf3w3OddFQ1). It's a video series all about Compute Engine, starting with a discussion of building reliable systems from unreliable components.
