[Gabi Ferrara](https://twitter.com/gabidavila) joins [Mark Mirchandani](https://twitter.com/markmirch) today for an in-depth interview with [Dale Markowitz](https://twitter.com/dalequark) about machine learning in the healthcare and medical fields. Dale talks about the coolest ways ML is transforming the healthcare field with advances in imaging and more accurate diagnoses of cancers.

Later, Dale talks about how the cloud is used in healthcare to make data collection and sharing more efficient. The Google For Healthcare API, for example, makes working with common medical data types such as FHIR easier and more consistent. It helps with things like anonymizing of data and works with BigQuery for data analyzation. When data is collected and stored in the right format, it can be used to track healing progress, make health predictions, and more.
