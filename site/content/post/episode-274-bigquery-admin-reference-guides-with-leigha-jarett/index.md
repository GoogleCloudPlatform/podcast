Your hosts [Stephanie Wong](https://twitter.com/stephr_wong) and [Alicia Williams](https://twitter.com/presactlyalicia) talk about BigQuery Admin Reference Guides with guest [Leigha Jarett](https://twitter.com/leighajarett). Leigha tells us a bit about the origins of the Admin Reference Guide, which was developed to address frequent customer questions. The series of guides and videos covers onboarding topics from resource hierarchy and APIs to BigQuery tables and storage in an effort to help new admins get started.

The team's Reference Guide on tables helps admins understand the difference between federated and native tables, and Leigha tells our listeners some tips for using each type. Slots and reservations for workload management in BigQuery can be challenging to understand, but these Reference Guides and accompanying videos offer clear explanations. Optimizing projects for speed and monetary efficiency are important topics for any client, and Leigha and the optimization team have addressed these concerns as well. Tips for monitoring, data governance, and the secure sharing of data are also included in their video series, BigQuery Spotlight.

We wrap up with a discussion on BigQuery APIs and how easy it is to integrate BigQuery and other Google products.
