This week on the show, our guests [Anu Srivastava](https://twitter.com/asrivas_dev) and Sudheera Vanguri talk about Document AI with hosts [Stephanie Wong](https://twitter.com/stephr_wong) and [Dale Markowitz](https://twitter.com/dalequark). Document AI uses artificial intelligence to improve the way businesses create and manage things like paystubs, tax forms, contracts, and virtually any other business document. Data normally stored on paper can be parsed, enriched, and structured, then stored securely with the use of Document AI. Data becomes more accessible and more manageable.

Our guests go on to describe the process of using this powerful tool and instances where developers and enterprise companies could benefit. We talk about Lending DocAI and Procurement DocAI and how offerings like Google Vision and Knowledge Graph enhance these powerful tools. Users of Document AI can take advantage of these tools as well as bring their own expertise to create custom models.

Later, we learn about the developer experience when using the Document AI Platform. Our guests talk specifically about the use of Knowledge Graph and how the advanced search capabilities allow Document AI users to collect data from myriad sources, filling in missing information and enhancing the search with other useful data to make your results more usable. To demonstrate the use of the platform and integrated Google AI tools, we hear about the real-world examples of Workday and Mr. Cooper and their document processing and model training.
