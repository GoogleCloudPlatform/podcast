Dustin Dye and Alex Seegers of [Botcopy](https://twitter.com/botcopyinc) are on the show today, chatting with hosts [Mark Mirchandani](https://twitter.com/markmirch) and [Priyanka Vergadia](https://twitter.com/pvergadia). Botcopy uses advanced AI technology along with excellent copy writing to create better chat bots. The software works directly on a company website and doesn't require a login, allowing chats to stay anonymous.

 Our guests explain that their chat bots are treated like virtual employees, built and trained to function and speak appropriately for their specific job. Copy writing is an important part of this, as the conversational AI should continue to support the brand being represented and conversations should flow naturally. The bot personalities are developed through written copy and interactions with customers in instances like customer service, lead generation, and even some internal employee management needs.
 
 Later, we talk about how Dialogflow and Botcopy work together, including how Botcopy adds important user context to the conversation to facilitate more accurate bot responses. We hear more about Dialogflow CX and how the modular builder makes designing and controlling bot conversations easier. CX has also made managing multiple bots on a single account easier and team collaboration more efficient. The visual builder available in CX offers a better chatbot design experience, especially when multiple teams are working on the same bot. We hear examples of great use-cases for Botcopy, like restaurant menus, clinical trials, and more.
 
 Alex and Dustin give developers valuable advice about working with clients to build their bots. Test early and often to build a robust bot capable of handling many situations. It's important to have an analytics system in place to identify possible improvement areas as well.
