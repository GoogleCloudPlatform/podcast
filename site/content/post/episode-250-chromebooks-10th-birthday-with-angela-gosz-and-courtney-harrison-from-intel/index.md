[Jenny Brown](https://twitter.com/jbrojbrojbro) and [Mark Mirchandani](https://twitter.com/markmirch) are back this week to celebrate a special anniversary! This year marks ten years since the launch of the first Chromebooks, and our guests, Angela Gosz and Courtney Harrison, are here to reflect on the past and talk about the future Chrome OS.  Chromebooks powered by Intel allow users to get the most out of their endpoints, serving as a secure and stable entrypoint to the Cloud.

Our guests describe the main groups of Chromebook users and how the ease of use, portability, and customization benefits each. The Google Admin Console allows more than 500 customizable security features to tailor the experience for employees or end customers, Angela explains. The changes brought on by the pandemic meant more companies had to support a distributed business, and Chromebook with the Admin Console has been able to facilitate this transition easily. With the new ZTE program, Chromebooks can be sent directly to employees, bypassing IT. The computers can be configured through the console without any physical contact.

Courtney tells us her experiences with Chromebook at Intel and how the automatic updates, computing speed, and other features have made her job easier. She explains the process of working with Google to develop the hardware needed for Chromebook and how the cloud comes into play for maximum performance. We talk about many of the other Chromebook options offered and what options will be available in the future.
