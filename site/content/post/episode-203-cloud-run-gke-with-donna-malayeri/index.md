[Jon](https://twitter.com/syntxerror1) and [Aja](https://twitter.com/the_thagomizer) host our guest [Donna Malayeri](https://twitter.com/lindydonna) this week to learn all about Cloud Run and Anthos! Designed to provide serverless containers, Cloud Run has two versions: fully managed and Cloud Run for Anthos. 

Donna's passion for serverless projects and containers shows as we discuss how these options benefit developers and customers. With containers, developers are able to go serverless without a lot of the typical restrictions, and because they are a standard format, containers are fairly easy to learn to use. Tools such as Ko can even do the work of generating docker containers for you. One of Cloud Run's most unique features is that it allows developers to bring existing applications. You don't have to rewrite your entire app to make it serverless! Developers can also reuse instances, making the process more efficient and cost effective. 

Cloud Run for Anthos allows projects to stay on-prem while still enjoying the benefits of containers and the Cloud Run platform.

Later in the show, Donna tells us about Knative, which is the API Cloud Run is based on that helps create portability between Cloud Run versions, as well as portability to other vendors. We also get to hear the weirdest things she's seen put in a container and run in Cloud Run!
