[Priyanka Vergadia](https://twitter.com/pvergadia) joins [Mark Mirchandani](https://twitter.com/markmirch) today to talk shop with [Travis DePuy](https://twitter.com/xM_Tinkerer) about all things digital services. Travis is a product evangelist for xMatters, a company that provides digital services for clients in a way that makes it easy for them to "limit the blast radius" as they build and use their projects. At xMatters, customers can build an incident management workflow for their custom services and integrate the tools of their choice. Travis talks about service degradation and how xMatters helps clients optimize and manage their services to control instances of degradation. With programs like Google Stackdriver, xMatters can set limits and get alerts when thresholds are met, then use that information to fix performance.

Later in the show, Travis talks about moving a large enterprise like xMatters to the cloud.
