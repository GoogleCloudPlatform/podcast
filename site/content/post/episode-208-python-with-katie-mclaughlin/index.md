[Aja Hammerly](https://twitter.com/the_thagomizer) and [Brian Dorsey](https://twitter.com/briandorsey) are here this week to start off a new year of podcasts! In an interview with Google Developer Advocate [Katie McLaughlin](https://twitter.com/glasnt), we talk about the advantages of Python 3 and why version 2 has been retired, as well as the cool things you can do with Django. 

Later, Katie discusses the complexities of deployment and how she makes it work smoothly with GCP, and we have some fun with emojis!
